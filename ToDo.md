# To-Do List for Week 7 Salary Calculator

## Main Project

- [ ] Create and source in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
- [ ] Add input framework for employee info form
  - [ ] first name
  - [ ] last name
  - [ ] ID number
  - [ ] job title
  - [ ] annual salary
  - [ ] submit button
- [ ] Submit button collects the form info and stores it array
- [ ] Append info to DOM in a table
- [ ] Calculate monthly cost
  - [ ] append to DOM
- [ ] If total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, make cell background red
- [ ] Add delete button that removes an employee from the DOM

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Remove deleted employee's salary from the total. "This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. You will need to use `.text()` as a getter or look into jQuery's `.data()` function."

## Do Later

- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] CSS stylings
