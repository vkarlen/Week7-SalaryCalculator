# To-Do List for Week 7 Salary Calculator

## Main Project

- [x] Create and source in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
- [x] Add input framework for employee info form
  - [x] first name
  - [x] last name
  - [x] ID number
  - [x] job title
  - [x] annual salary
  - [x] submit button
- [x] Submit button collects the form info and stores it array
- [x] Append info to DOM in a table
- [x] Calculate monthly cost
  - [x] append to DOM
- [x] If total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, make cell background red
- [x] Add delete button that removes an employee from the DOM

## Stretch Goals

- [x] Remove deleted employee's salary from the total. "This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. You will need to use `.text()` as a getter or look into jQuery's `.data()` function."
- [ ] Make all fields required

## Do Later

- [x] Clean up code
- [x] CSS stylings
